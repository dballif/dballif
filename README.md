### Hi there 👋

## Why I'm a Developer:
It gives me the opporutunity to continue to learn about whatever I want to by providing a hands on experience building something. There are so many opportunities to build cool things in pretty much every domain. I don't have nearly enough time to go learn about all the things I want to learn, let alone actually build soemthing cool with that new knowledge.

## What I'm Currently Working On:
Well, there's a few projects in the works right now.

I'm currently working on 3D printing and building out a remote controlled rover. After an initial build, the plan is to program some brains for it that will allow for autonomous driving and data collection.

Another project, that's kind of on the backburner for the moment, is a environment monitoring system for a beehive that uses MQTT to send data to a remote database. 

## What I'm Learning Right Now:
I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ Certification. My goal is taking the test by the end of August 2023. Feel free to ask me how it's going.

I've also just started learning Solidity, becuase web3 is something I don't know a ton about yet, but it seems like there are going to be some reallhy cool opporutunities there.

## Other Interests
Cybersecurity - Beyond being super important, it's incredibly fascinating. I'm currently reading "This is How They Tell Me the World Ends" by Nicole Perlroth. Fascinating. And a little concerning.

Fly Fishing - Not gonna lie, I'm really bad at it, but I really enjoy it (I am more than open to any tips!)
